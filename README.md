# SolanaBitcoin Rewards Program

# Overview

This project includes a smart contract for a token reward system targeting long-term holders. It utilizes the Anchor framework for Solana, comprising a client written in JavaScript for interacting with the Solana blockchain, and a smart contract developed in Rust.\

## How does the program work?
TBD

## Smart Contract Functionality
- LockFunds: Lock an amount of funds in the smart contract.
- UnlockFunds: Unlock the funds.
- GetLockInfo: Retrieve information about the locked funds.
- ClaimRewards: Retrieved the obtained tokens 

## Development
- Client (TypeScript)
The client is responsible for sending transactions to the Solana network for debug purposes. It uses the @solana/web3.js library.

- Smart Contract (Rust)
The smart contract processes instructions for locking and unlocking funds. It's written in Rust using the Solana Program Library (SPL).
